# InboxTest-for-Web3
Its my first proyect deploying a contract to the ethereum rinkeby test, and it worked :)

I set up an ethereum contract with simple and fixed values, with the functionality to send a message if the contract is called. The value of the proyect lies on the 
practice and experiencie gained by creating, compiling and deploying a proyect to the ethereum blockchain
